# Assessment Database Structure

## Purpose

This document defines the schema for the stock-assessment database in `analysis/comp_assessments/database/`.

The database preserves, in a tidy and auditable form, the inputs, assumptions, and outputs of official age-structured stock assessments.

The canonical database contains five CSV files:

``` text
analysis/comp_assessments/
└── database/
    ├── stocks.csv
    ├── assessments.csv
    ├── assumptions.csv
    ├── inputs.csv
    └── outputs.csv
```

All canonical tables should remain ordinary CSV files so they can be inspected directly in R, Excel, or a text editor.

This document defines the canonical source records and database schema. It does
not define stock-specific analysis transformations, model settings, or
comparisons. Use `PROTOCOL.md` to obtain, verify, or repair records. If a
downstream analysis reveals a source-data gap, validate and revise the affected
database records while keeping analysis-specific choices separate.

## Core principles

1.  **Represent the official assessment faithfully.** Preserve the dimensions and meaning of the official model, including fleets, surveys, sexes, regions, and seasons where applicable.
2.  **Preserve provenance.** Material data and assumptions should be traceable to an authoritative file, object, table, document, or documented reconstruction.
3.  **Keep the canonical database source-focused.** Tidy reshaping is allowed, but downstream-analysis transformations and settings do not belong in the canonical tables.

`stock_id` identifies the biological or management stock.

`assessment_id` identifies a particular assessment event or official assessment run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. `stocks.csv`

One row per biological or management stock.

## Required columns

| Column | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `stock_id` | Stable internal identifier for the stock |
| `charbonneau_id` | Identifier in the Charbonneau–Keith database, when applicable |
| `authority` | Assessment authority, e.g. DFO, ICES, NOAA-AFSC |
| `authority_stock_id` | Current official stock identifier/code |
| `scientific_name` | Scientific name |
| `common_name` | Common name |
| `area` | Assessment or management area |
| `region` | Broader geographic region |
| `ocean` | Regional basin: Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, or Northwest Pacific |
| `notes` | Stock-identity, boundary, split/merge, or other notes |

## Identifier rules

`stock_id` should be readable, unique, stable through time, and independent of assessment year.

Examples:

``` text
dfo_cod_2j3kl
ices_cod_north_sea
afsc_pollock_ebs
```

Do not embed an assessment year in `stock_id`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. `assessments.csv`

One row per assessment event or model run represented in the database.

## Required columns

| Column | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `assessment_id` | Stable identifier for this assessment |
| `stock_id` | Foreign key to `stocks.csv` |
| `assessment_year` | Year of the assessment/advice |
| `terminal_year` | Last year of data fitted by the model |
| `estimate_terminal_year` | Last year with a population estimate reported; may be later than `terminal_year` |
| `assessment_type` | Annual, update, benchmark, framework, etc. |
| `model_family` | SAM, Stock Synthesis, WHAM, NCAM, VPA/ADAPT, etc. |
| `model_version` | Model/package/version identifier where known |
| `is_current` | Whether this is the most recent official assessment with detailed inputs, assumptions, and outputs recoverable for the canonical database. A newer summary-only assessment is recorded separately and does not displace it; see `PROTOCOL.md`. |
| `is_applied` | Whether this assessment was applied for advice in its assessment cycle. A current detailed benchmark can be `FALSE` if it has not yet been used for advice; more than one historical assessment can be `TRUE`. |
| `framework_year` | Benchmark/framework year defining the current model, if distinct |
| `assessment_url` | Main authoritative assessment/report URL |
| `framework_url` | Benchmark/framework/methodology URL |
| `data_url` | Official input-data URL where distinct |
| `model_url` | Native model object/run URL where distinct |
| `repository_url` | Reproducible assessment repository where available |
| `assumptions_status` | Completeness of assumptions extraction |
| `inputs_status` | Completeness of official-model input extraction |
| `outputs_status` | Completeness of official-model output extraction |
| `notes` | Assessment-level caveats or provenance notes |

## Status values

Use:

``` text
not_started
partial
complete
not_applicable
```

Use `not_applicable` sparingly.

Status fields describe completeness relative to the official assessment, not relative to a downstream analysis.

Keep translation readiness, fitting failures, convergence results, and
comparison completion in analysis diagnostics. A partial source record can
support a documented limited analysis, and a complete source record can still
require modeling approximations. Neither case changes what these status
fields mean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. `assumptions.csv`

Long-format description of biological and statistical assumptions.

## Required columns

| Column | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `assessment_id` | Foreign key |
| `component` | Population, recruitment, N, F, M, catch, index, q, biology, etc. |
| `fleet` | Fleet to which the assumption applies |
| `survey` | Survey/index to which the assumption applies |
| `sex` | Sex to which the assumption applies |
| `region` | Region to which the assumption applies |
| `season` | Season to which the assumption applies |
| `setting` | Name of the assumption |
| `value` | Value or concise description |
| `source_reference` | Specific file, object field, table, page, or section |
| `notes` | Clarification, interpretation, or unresolved ambiguity |

Blank `fleet`, `survey`, `sex`, `region`, or `season` fields mean the assumption is not specific to that dimension.

If an important assumption cannot be resolved, use:

``` text
value = unknown
```

and explain the unresolved issue in `notes`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. `inputs.csv`

Long-format representation of numerical inputs supplied to the official assessment.

## Required columns

| Column | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `assessment_id` | Foreign key |
| `type` | Broad input family |

| `region` | Spatial region used by the fitted model |
| `season` | Season |
| `year` | Calendar/model year, or cohort identifier when year_basis says so; blank for time-invariant inputs |
| `year_basis` | Meaning of `year`: `calendar_year`, `model_year` (document the native annual period), or `birth_cohort` |
| `age` | Age |
| `value` | Numerical value |
| `unit` | Explicit unit |
| `sampling_time` | Timing within year as a fraction from 0 to 1 when part of the source/model definition |

| `notes` | Additional clarification |

## Initial `type` vocabulary

``` text
catch
index
weight
catch_weight
maturity
M
covariate
biology
```

Add new types only when a real assessment requires them.

## Initial `measure` vocabulary

### Catch/removals and indices

``` text
numbers_at_age
numbers_at_age_for_M_reconstruction
index_by_age_group
biomass_at_age
total_numbers
total_biomass
total_egg_production
landings_lower_bound
landings_upper_bound
catch_lower_bound
catch_upper_bound
proportion_at_age
relative_biomass_index
relative_precision_weight
relative_standard_error
```

An index_by_age_group row preserves a native index value that combines
multiple age classes and cannot be represented as a single-age observation.
Store the lower age in age and record the full source age interval, including
any plus group, in notes. This measure is kept for provenance and is not
passed to tinyAM's single-age index likelihood.

`numbers_at_age_for_M_reconstruction` preserves an age-specific total catch
series used to reconstruct a separate natural-mortality input. It is distinct
from the residual catch series fitted in the assessment. Do not treat both
series as separate catch observations in a downstream model.

For `type = index`, `measure = numbers_at_age` normally uses `basis = numbers`
and a documented count unit. When the source reports age-specific index values
but does not state its scale multiplier, use `basis = index_scale` and record
the reported quantity with the missing scale noted, for example
`number (index scale; multiplier not stated)`. Preserve the values without
guessing a conversion factor, and explain whether they are used as direct
observations or as inputs to a separate age-composition and aggregate-index
likelihood.

### Biology

``` text
weight_at_age
start_weight_at_age
maturity_at_age
natural_mortality_at_age
fecundity_at_age
proportion_female_at_age
fraction_F_before_spawning
fraction_M_before_spawning
landings_numbers_at_age
discard_numbers_at_age
landings_fraction_at_age
landings_weight_at_age
discard_weight_at_age
log_index_sd
landings_proportion
```

`landings_numbers_at_age`, `discard_numbers_at_age`, and
`landings_fraction_at_age` retain removal components used by a source model
alongside its combined catch. Landings and discard weights are distinct from
combined catch weights. `log_index_sd` stores a supplied
standard deviation of the log survey index as a separate year record, with age
when the index is age-specific, and
the same survey identity as the corresponding observation; use `type = index`,
`basis = log_scale`, and document whether it fixes variance or supplies a relative
weight. `landings_proportion` retains a source landings-weight composition by substock
or quarter (`basis = proportion_biomass`); these records have no age. Reference
components are retained, and report rounding is not silently renormalized.
Landings fractions should normally lie in `[0, 1]`. If an official model input
contains values slightly above one, preserve them without clipping and explain
the source-specific exception in `notes`; the validator accepts only documented
`landings_fraction_at_age` exceptions. Other input proportions must remain in
`[0, 1]`.

`relative_precision_weight` stores a native relative precision weight for an
age-specific catch or index observation. Use the corresponding input type
(`catch` or `index`) and basis = `relative_precision`. Record the weight scale
and any equivalent relative log-SD transformation in the notes.

`observation_likelihood_weight` preserves a source likelihood weight when its
effect is not documented well enough to interpret as a precision or standard-
deviation multiplier. Use the corresponding input type, `basis = relative_scale`,
and retain the supplied value without transforming it. Explain the source
field and whether tinyAM currently uses it.

`relative_standard_error` stores the source-reported standard error divided by
the estimate for an age-specific catch or index observation. Use basis =
`relative_scale`, retain the reported value and unit, and record whether the
assessment used it as an observation weight. It is a source precision measure,
not an observation or a tinyAM-estimated standard error.

For an aggregate catch or index CV, leave `age` blank and match the same total
observation by year and its fleet or survey dimensions. Preserve catch
`partition` when it distinguishes landings and discards. This records one
aggregate precision value without repeating it over ages.

`relative_biomass_index` stores an aggregate relative index, such as standardized
CPUE tuned to exploitable biomass. It is not an absolute biomass observation;
use `basis = index_scale` and document the scale and model interpretation.

`landings_lower_bound` and `landings_upper_bound` preserve source bounds for a
censored total-landings likelihood. Store each bound separately using the same
year, fleet, unit and basis as its landings observation.

`larval_abundance_index` represents an index tied to a spawning component. Use
`type = index`, `basis = numbers`, blank fish age, and record the spawning
component in `region` and survey time window in `season`. Native units and
configured model timing should be documented separately; time-window column
numbers are not fish ages.

`index_sd` stores a supplied standard deviation on the native scale of a survey
index, matched to the same survey and year as the observation. Use
`type = index`, `basis = index_scale`, and the same units as the index. If the
model transforms this SD for its likelihood, document that transformation in
`notes`; retain the supplied value here.

Additional measures may be added when necessary, but should remain explicit and biologically interpretable.

`catch_lower_bound` and `catch_upper_bound` preserve bounds used by a censored
total-catch likelihood; they are distinct from landings bounds. `start_weight_at_age`
is a source model's January 1 weight surface when it differs in meaning from the
annual stock-weight surface. `total_egg_production` stores an aggregate egg
count index; it is not a biomass index or age-specific fish-abundance index.
`fecundity_at_age` and `proportion_female_at_age` retain the biological inputs
used to calculate egg production. Use type `biology` for these biological
surfaces when no existing type represents their meaning.

`fixed_mortality_medium`, `fixed_mortality_low` and `fixed_mortality_high`
retain the reported scalar M settings for the three BC petrale ensemble
components (`type = M`, `basis = per_year`). Leave year and age blank: these
are distinct component parameters, not a recovered age-specific input surface
or a single averaged ensemble M. Component weights and unresolved sex/age
application belong in assumptions and notes. Observation translation does not
use these records as `natural_mortality_at_age` inputs.

## Initial `basis` vocabulary

``` text
numbers
biomass
proportion_numbers
proportion_biomass
kg_per_fish
g_per_fish
proportion
per_year
log_scale
relative_precision
relative_scale
index_scale
egg_count
```

Use `basis = egg_count` for egg-production observations and document the scale
in `unit`, such as `trillion eggs`. It must not be converted to fish numbers
without a source-supported model relationship.

For example:

``` text
type = index
measure = proportion_at_age
basis = proportion_numbers
```

is distinct from:

``` text
type = index
measure = proportion_at_age
basis = proportion_biomass
```

## `source_type`

Use:

``` text
native_model
official_machine_readable
official_table
official_document
digitized
reconstructed_source_input
derived_source_output
charbonneau_seed
```

Use `official_document` for values stated in an official report's prose when
they are not presented in a numerical table. Use `official_table` for values
transcribed from tables and `digitized` for values recovered from figures.

`reconstructed_source_input` means that the actual official-model input was not directly available but was reconstructed from authoritative source quantities. Record the reconstruction in `transformation`.

Do not use `reconstructed_source_input` for values derived solely for a downstream analysis.

## Reshaping

Changing a source table from wide to long form is allowed when scientific meaning is unchanged.

Preserve the quantities and dimensions actually used by the official model.
When a source input must be reconstructed from other authoritative source
quantities, record the calculation, source references, and units in
`transformation`, with `source_type = reconstructed_source_input`. If the model
uses separate total and composition observations, retain them as separate
source inputs rather than presenting a derived quantity as a native input.
Do not place values derived only for a downstream analysis in the canonical
tables. Keep source quantities needed to reproduce a documented reconstruction,
and do not sum overlapping direct and reconstructed values. Include other
removal details when they are part of the official model or needed to document
the source inputs.

Example:

``` text
year | age1 | age2 | age3
```

may be represented as:

``` text
year | age | value
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. `outputs.csv`

Long-format outputs from the official assessment.

## Required columns

| Column             | Description                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| `assessment_id`    | Foreign key                     |
| `type`             | Broad family: population, mortality, biomass, recruitment, catch, index, catchability, or biology |
| `measure`          | Exact output represented        |
| `fleet`            | Fleet where applicable          |
| `survey`           | Survey where applicable         |
| `sex`              | Sex where applicable            |
| `region`           | Region where applicable         |
| `season`           | Season where applicable         |
| `year`             | Year; blank for time-invariant estimates such as reported catchability parameters |
| `age`              | Age where applicable            |
| `age_group`        | Optional age range for grouped measures such as Fbar or Mbar |
| `value`            | Point estimate                  |
| `se`               | Standard error if available     |
| `lwr`              | Lower interval if available     |
| `upr`              | Upper interval if available     |
| `unit`             | Unit                            |
| `source_type`      | Provenance category             |
| `source_reference` | Specific file/table/object/page |
| `notes`            | Additional clarification        |

## High-priority output measures

``` text
numbers_at_age
fishing_mortality_at_age
natural_mortality_at_age
SSB
recruitment
```

Use `natural_mortality_at_age` when M is estimated.

## Secondary output measures

``` text
total_biomass
mature_biomass_at_age
biomass_by_age_group
total_mortality_at_age
predicted_catch
predicted_index
Fbar
Mbar
q
Fmsy
Bmsy
msy
```

Use measures defined by the official assessment. `derived_source_output` may
also record an explicitly requested summary calculated from that assessment's
reported outputs and documented biology. Preserve the native values, identify
the formula and age range in notes, and leave uncertainty missing when the
required covariance is unavailable. State timing differences explicitly: a
sum of January 1 mature biomass is not an April 1 SSB estimate.

biomass_by_age_group stores a reported aggregate biomass for a named age group, such as 3+. Put the group label in age_group and leave age blank; it is not an age-specific biomass surface.

Retain uncertainty where readily available. Parameter estimates reported by the official assessment may be stored as `type = biology`, with `measure` naming the exact parameter and `age` or `year` set only when that dimension applies.

## Uncertainty and estimate definitions

The `se` column records a standard error, not a coefficient of variation (CV).
Document its scale in `notes`: normally the natural scale of `value`, or an
explicitly reported log scale. Identify delta-method natural-scale SEs as
approximations. Do not silently put a CV in `se` or infer a scale from the size
of the number. If only a CV is available, preserve it with its source meaning
in notes; any conversion to an SE must be justified and documented.

For `lwr` and `upr`, record the interval level and whether it is a confidence
or credible interval. Identify whether `value` is a mean, median, or another
reported estimate when that distinction matters. Unknown uncertainty or
interval construction remains unknown; missing values must not be interpreted
as zero uncertainty or used to invent new intervals.

Keep native definitions, such as recruitment age, SSB timing and sex convention,
Fbar age range and weighting, and terminal age groups, in the associated
assumptions and row notes. Common-definition comparisons belong in analysis
outputs rather than replacing source values here.

`type` identifies the broad output family; `measure` identifies the exact
quantity. For example, an age-specific fishing mortality row uses
`type = mortality` and `measure = fishing_mortality_at_age`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Canonical-data integrity

Validation should check:

- required columns;
- unique `stock_id`;
- unique `assessment_id`;
- valid foreign keys;
- controlled `source_type` values;
- sensible year, age, and numerical fields;
- maturity proportions in `[0,1]`;
- `sampling_time` in `[0,1]` where represented numerically;
- duplicate canonical rows;
- missing fleet or survey labels where the model distinguishes them;
- unexplained multiple current assessments for the same stock.

Per-assessment summaries should include:

- input rows by `type`, `measure`, fleet, and survey;
- fleets represented;
- surveys represented;
- year and age coverage;
- outputs represented;
- assumptions represented.

Downstream-analysis-specific transformations, settings, compatibility judgments, and fitted results do not belong in the canonical database.

`spawning_weight_at_age` distinguishes supplied spawning-stock weights from
population weights when the source uses different biological surfaces. Use
`type = weight`, with `basis = kg_per_fish` or `g_per_fish` matching the
source unit; do not label biological purposes as spatial regions.

## Native length and conditional age compositions

`mat_beta1` and `mat_beta2` are signed coefficients of a documented fitted
logistic maturity curve (`type = biology` in outputs). Their SEs are on the
coefficient scale. These time-invariant estimates may have blank years; they
are outputs, not a supplied maturity-at-age input vector.

`frequency_at_length` with `basis = native_frequency` and `unit = source
frequency` preserves supplied length-frequency vectors when the native files
mix counts and proportions. Preserve the row totals and record the source's
normalization rule; these are composition samples, not removal or abundance
counts. `maturity_sample_size` and `mature_sample_count` retain female biological
sampling counts used by an estimated maturity likelihood (`type = biology`,
`basis = numbers`, `unit = fish`), with `observation_id` identifying the dataset.
`composition_sample_count` likewise preserves the raw number of sampled fish
when a model supplies a transformed/reweighted count to its composition
likelihood. Keep the actual supplied likelihood count in `sample_size` on the
composition cells and describe its transformation; neither quantity is the
model's estimated effective sample size.

`proportion_at_length` and `conditional_proportion_at_age` retain the composition
representation consumed by an assessment. Use `basis = proportion_numbers` and
`unit = proportion`. Do not replace these with an unconditional age distribution.

Optional input columns preserve their dimensions:

- `observation_id`: stable source record identifier, shared by its composition cells.
- `length_bin`: native length-bin label for a length composition, in cm.
- `length_bin_lower`, `length_bin_upper`: native conditioning-bin codes/bounds for
  conditional age composition; specify the coding method and units in notes.
- `sample_size`: supplied input sample size, distinct from an estimated effective size.
- `age_error`: native ageing-error definition code; interpretation belongs in assumptions.
- `partition`: native retained/discard/combined observation code, documented in notes.

These columns are blank for inputs to which they do not apply. Preserve the
source month in notes and record survey timing separately as a fraction of year.

## Covariates

``` text
environmental_covariate
condition_index_for_mortality
capelin_biomass_index
```

Use `type = covariate` and `basis = native_covariate` for supplied covariates
used by the model. `environmental_covariate` records environmental series;
`condition_index_for_mortality` records a fish-condition index used to inform a
time-varying natural-mortality process. Retain the source scale and timing.
Signed finite values are permitted. Do not treat either covariate as an
abundance index or, for the condition index, as a natural-mortality estimate.
`capelin_biomass_index` preserves a source Capelin biomass index used to form
a prey-to-cod biomass ratio for a mortality model. Record its spatial coverage
and units; it is not a cod abundance index or a direct M estimate.

`type = biology` with `fraction_F_before_spawning` or
`fraction_M_before_spawning` records supplied year-age mortality fractions used
in spawning biomass, with `basis = proportion`. Preserve fleet dimensions for F
where present. These are biological inputs, separate from survey sampling timing.

Time-invariant `q_power` outputs may have a blank year, like `q`. Record the
power separately from the catchability coefficient and document the observation
equation; a coefficient in a power relationship is not a simple catch fraction.
Natural-scale SEs obtained by the delta method must be identified as such.

## Native age frequencies and fecundity weights

`frequency_at_age` uses `basis = native_frequency` to retain source age
compositions supplied as counts or percentages rather than unit-sum proportions.
Keep the original units (for example `percent`), row totals, sample sizes and
age-error codes, and describe the source normalization. Normalization for a
tinyAM translation belongs outside the canonical tables.

`maturity_fecundity_at_age` uses `type = biology`, `basis = kg_per_fish` and
the original weight units to retain supplied maturity-times-fecundity weights.
It is not a maturity proportion. Record the source sex fraction, minimum mature
age and SSB equation separately. Deriving a maturity proportion for tinyAM by
dividing this product by population weight is an analysis transformation.

`fishing_mortality_intensity` is an annual mortality output parameter before
age selectivity. It is neither F-at-age nor an age-averaged Fbar; do not substitute
it for either comparison. `exploitation_fraction_at_age` retains the source
removal fraction and its original unit (such as percent), which likewise is
not an instantaneous F. Record the source definitions and estimate conventions.
