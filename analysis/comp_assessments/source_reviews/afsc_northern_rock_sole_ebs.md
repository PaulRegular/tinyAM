# Eastern Bering Sea northern rock sole

## Official model and sources

`afsc_northern_rock_sole_ebs_2024` is the final 2024 SSC-selected Model 24.2.
It estimates female M as well as male M; Model 18.3 and Model 24.1 are not
substituted. Charbonneau–Keith identifies the stock as
`AFSC_EEBSAI_Lepidopsetta_polyxystra`. It is one BSAI management stock,
with an Eastern Bering Sea assessment area and two sexes, not two cases.
The 2025 funding lapse did not produce a replacement fitted assessment.

The [2024 SAFE report](https://files.npfmc.org/SAFE/2024/BSAIrocksole.pdf)
and [native Model 24.2 inputs](https://github.com/noaa-afsc/BSAI_NRS/tree/71cf64a8f5c3b22ed99378a9bd2a754c5e0d3bdf/2024/model_runs/model_24.2)
are cached locally with retrieval dates, checksums and a pinned revision.
The public run directory supplies inputs, not fitted output files. Current
outputs are therefore extracted from the final report's Model 24.2 columns.
The [flatfish framework code](https://github.com/noaa-afsc/flatfish_assessment_code/blob/9709548fafc7d69a2e3f88f80f60c74b7d3cfb0e/src/fm.tpl)
is separately pinned and used to verify equations, not to replace current data.

## Inputs and active processes

The model covers 1975–2024, ages 1–20+, female/male, one fishery and one EBS
bottom-trawl survey. Catch and survey biomass are in **thousand tonnes**;
weights are **kg/fish**, unlike yellowfin sole's grams. Joint-sex number
compositions and their supplied sample sizes are preserved. The source
normalizes supplied joint rows across both sexes, not within each sex.
There are 42 fishery age-sample years; 1995–1997 are absent, not zero. Survey
age samples and survey biomass cover different year sets; no unobserved age
composition is manufactured for the terminal 2024 biomass observation.

Empirical population, catch and survey weights are distinct original inputs
under Growth_Option 1. Source zeros and repeated terminal weights are retained.
Female maturity is supplied; SSB uses survival to **February 1 (1/12)**.
The fishery log-catch residual sum of squares has weight 300. Survey biomass
uses supplied natural-scale SE transformed to a log SD. The biomass prediction
is at time 0.5, whereas age-composition predictions use begin-year N. Francis
composition weighting and the source multinomial offsets are not equivalent
to independent age-specific lognormal observations.

Female M is estimated at 0.192 (SE 0.003), male M at 0.226 (SE 0.004), rounded
in Table 8.14. Both have a lognormal prior with mean 0.15 and log width 0.2.
Scalar survey q is estimated at 1.633 (SE 0.050), with prior mean 1.5 and log
width 0.2. Its sex-specific logistic selectivity remains separate. Temperature
arrays exist in the data file, but q and growth temperature effects are
inactive under negative phases. They are not attributed to the production fit.

Survival is deterministic, recruitment is equally split between sexes, initial
age parameters are active, and a fitted Ricker relationship with lag one is
penalized over 1978–2018 with fixed log SD 0.6. Annual F multiplies sex-specific
logistic curves with log deviations in slope and age at 50% selectivity;
ages 17+ share fishery selectivity and the male multiplier is estimated.

## Output recovery and validation

Native N is printed in whole **million fish**. Tables 8.20–8.24 give female
SSB, all-age biomass, combined-sex age-1 recruitment and both sexes' N. SSB,
biomass and recruitment retain natural-scale asymptotic SEs. Neither state
SEs nor combined confidence intervals are invented.

F-at-age is derived from rounded annual F deviations, slope/a50 deviations
and Table 8.14 parameters using the pinned source equations. It is not
inferred from rounded N. Some minus signs in the PDF wrap above their numbers;
the extractor reads each target cell geometrically and checks a visually
verified negative cell. The resulting non-plus-group cohort survival differs
from reported next-year N by at most 1.70 million females and 1.52 million
males, consistent with whole-million N rounding and rounded M/curve parameters.
No F uncertainty is reconstructed without joint covariance.

The 2024 reference checks are SSB 271988 t, biomass 1051040 t and combined
age-1 recruitment 1462.25 million. Canonical units remain those originally
reported. Completeness stays partial: full ageing-error/control detail,
auxiliary input arrays and state covariance are not yet exported.
