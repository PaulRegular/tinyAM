# Aleutian Islands Pacific cod

## Production source and run identity

Charbonneau–Keith identity `AFSC_AI_Gadus_macrocephalus`. The December 2024
SSC selected age-structured Tier 3 Model 24.1. The historical catalogue's Tier 5
label is not a reason to exclude this case. The final November 15 SAFE report
is cached in `source_cache/afsc_cod_ai/`, along with the public native files
and report source at revision `bc170ea3acb7cea2f9c743653cd9648092b9ec25`.

The public `M24_1` fit is dated **September 26**, and does not reproduce final
November results. For example, public growth L1 is 14.1037 versus final
14.0937, estimated M is 0.571771 versus 0.5703, and projected female spawning
biomass/total biomass differ. The authors' November Rmd loads the unpublished
local directory `November2024/M24_1_data/run`. Do not combine the public
preliminary N/F/weight surfaces with final report outputs. Neither a matching
folder label nor a near-match of aggregate values establishes run identity.

## Recovered inputs

The final source models 1991–2024 and ages 0–13+, one combined-sex population.
Retain total catch in tonnes from Table 2A.6 for complete years through 2023.
For 2024 use the explicit **4,676 t model catch** in Table 2A.24, corroborated
in the native data file. Table 2A.6's **3,570 t** is partial reported landings
through September 22 and is not substituted for the full-year model catch.

The trawl biomass series is Table 2A.14, including 50,383 t in 2024. The source
table explicitly identifies these as model inputs. Its 2022 value 51,539 t
differs slightly from the regional table total 51,543 t; preserve the series
actually identified for the model. The fractional S.E. column is retained
with its original relative scale, not treated as tonnes or silently converted
to a log SD. Native survey month 7 corroborates midyear timing. The separately
tabulated longline index is not made part of the selected trawl likelihood.

Fishery observations are lengths; active survey age observations are
conditional age-at-length, not standardized abundance-at-age. Final production
composition arrays, stock weights and N/F outputs were not verified. Table
2A.17's maturity-at-age is a converted summary of a length ogive, not an
original supplied age-maturity matrix. The final length-ogive coefficients
are A=−8.589 and B=0.155; growth is estimated. Original weight–length parameters
are kg = 5.40706e-6 × cm^3.19601. Do not invent a population weight matrix or
use fitted preliminary N to allocate final observations.

M is fixed at 0.417 before 2016. From 2016 onward a replacement level is
estimated: final M=0.5703 with natural-scale SD 0.0371 (Table 2A.21). The fixed
pre-2016 values are inputs; the estimated block is an output, not a fixed input.

## Recovered outputs and definition caution

Final Model 24.1 biomass, reported SSB and age-0 recruitment are transcribed
from Tables 2A.18–20 with available original 95% limits. Ages/years and units
are retained; no SE is inferred from limits. The tables' pre-start labels
1989/1990 represent equilibrium/initial summaries for a model beginning 1991,
not additional assessment years, and are not imported as historical estimates.
In 2024 total biomass is 74,386 t, reported SSB 50,446 t (35,559–65,333),
and age-0 recruitment 76,193 thousand fish (63,933–90,805).

The SSB caption calls these female biomass, but its values exceed half of
total biomass and the projection table appears to use the half-scaled
single-sex convention. This definition remains unresolved without final
native output. Preserve the printed values and limits; do not silently halve
them or claim comparability to tinyAM female SSB.

## Translation blocker

No tinyAM fit is attempted from an unverified final data/biology combination.
A valid translation needs matching final length/conditional-age arrays and
weights, then an explicit defensible catch-at-age allocation and survey
conversion. Preliminary fitted surfaces are not a substitute. This is one
partial curated case, **not a completed runnable translation or actual fitting
attempt**. Missing data and unresolved definitions are explicit shortfalls,
not agreement passes. No starting-value or model rescue was attempted.

## Source and model review — 2026-10-17

Rechecked the production-run mismatch and missing final likelihood inputs. The source guard remains: no mixing preliminary fitted states with final November observations or inventing age data.

See [the complete twelve-case review](../PACIFIC_REVIEW.md#source-and-model-review) for paired median differences, correlations, diagnostics and rejected trials. Canonical numerical inputs and outputs are unchanged.
