# Celtic Sea haddock in divisions 7.b–k, 2026

## Assessment and sources

The current assessment is ICES `had.27.7b-k`, applied for 2026 advice. The WGCSE 2026 report identifies the 2025 SAM run `HAD7bk_2026` as the final assessment and says the procedure followed the 2020 stock annex, apart from the short-term recruitment assumption for 2026–2027. The fitted series ends in 2025; forecast values are not mixed into this record.

The 2026 report chapter, official SAM model and data objects, configuration, native `.dat` inputs, and result tables are cached under `source_cache/ices_haddock_7b_k_2026/`. `manifest.csv` records retrieval URLs, times, sizes, and SHA-256 checksums. The report says the TAF repository is empty and points to the named SAM run; the SAM run is therefore the source of the fitted model and inputs.

## Inputs and assumptions

The SAM model fits 1993–2025 at ages 0–8+, with age 8 as the plus group. The residual catch fleet is the combined catch from landings and discards. Catch-at-age is in thousands of fish. The native input file lists zero catch for age-0 cells and some older-age cells; their log observations are missing in the SAM data object, so these zeros are not fitted catch observations.

One age-specific survey index is used: `FRA_IRL_IBTS`, combining French EVHOE Q4 WIBTS and Irish IGFS Q4 WIBTS, standardized with VAST. It covers 2003–2025 at ages 0–7 and is sampled at 0.875 of the year. The source labels these values as VAST survey data but gives no physical unit or abundance multiplier; the database retains their native index scale. The 2005 age-7 index cell is missing in the SAM object and remains missing in the database and translation.

Annual stock, catch, landings, and discard weights are in kg per fish. Stock weights are a three-year running average and include discards. Maturity is fixed and age-specific. Natural mortality is fixed at 1.09, 0.72, 0.58, 0.48, 0.44, 0.41, 0.40, 0.39, and 0.36 per year for ages 0–8+, respectively. Landings fractions and F/M fractions before spawning are retained from the native data; the latter are zero.

The configuration uses lognormal likelihoods for catch and survey observations, independent residual errors, and no density-dependent q power. Catch shares one observation-variance parameter across ages; its observation weights are retained as relative likelihood weights (`fixVarToWeight = 0`). Survey q is age-specific for ages 0–7. Survey observation variance is shared across ages 0–5 and separately across ages 6–7. Recruitment follows a log random walk; the N process variance separates age 0 from ages 1–8. F follows a temporal random walk with AR(1) correlation across ages; ages 1–6 have separate states and ages 7 and 8 share one state. The reported Fbar uses ages 3–5.

## Outputs and limitations

The database contains start-of-year N-at-age and F-at-age from the fitted SAM object, annual recruitment, SSB, total stock biomass, and Fbar. Natural-scale N and F standard errors are delta-method conversions of the SAM log-state standard errors. Recruitment, SSB, total biomass, and Fbar retain the Low/High limits from the native SAM summary table; its interval confidence level is not specified. Total abundance is derived by summing official N-at-age over ages 0–8+ and has no uncertainty. M remains a fixed input rather than an estimated output.

Input and assumption extraction are complete for the assessment run. Output coverage is marked partial because fitted catch and index predictions and the q parameter table are not copied into the canonical outputs. The point-estimate surfaces used for the tinyAM comparison are available and tied to the same SAM run.

## tinyAM fit diagnostics

The package-default initialization was attempted first and failed during optimization with repeated NA/NaN gradient and function evaluations. One retry kept the same observations, formulas, and model settings, using year- and age-aligned official N-at-age, F-at-age, and index-derived q values as starting values. It failed with the same numerical error; no optimizer status, objective, standard errors, or dashboard were produced. The attempt log is cached locally at `results/cache/ices_haddock_celtic_sea_7b_k_2026/initialization_attempts.rds`.

The tinyAM process estimates F at age 0, whereas SAM fixes age-0 F to zero. This is a known model-structure difference for this translation; it was not changed after the failed fit.
