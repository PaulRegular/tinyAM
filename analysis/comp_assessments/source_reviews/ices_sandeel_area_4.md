# Sandeel in Area 4: detailed 2025 assessment

## Identity and selected assessment

`ices_sandeel_area_4_2025` represents the official ICES `san.sa.4` SMS-effort
assessment through 2024, covering the northern/central North Sea, Divisions
4.a–b. The stable stock ID is `ices_sandeel_area_4`, taxon *Ammodytes* spp.,
basin Northeast Atlantic. The broad Charbonneau–Keith
`ICES-HAWG_dubius_NS` entry is the catalogue starting point, not a verified
one-to-one regional identity. Its ID/taxonomy remain intact; no new catalogue
identifier is invented.

HAWG 2025 version 5 was published in March 2026. Its publication date does
not make this a 2026 age-based assessment. All 32 historical recruitment and
SSB values match official SAG 19335. The native repository is pinned at
`5ccb6abb2595153a88c9c47ad628ad17f3ea3e06`, independently verified against
remote HEAD, and declares smsR `a097011f2fff959c9a263e5f6acb49795b9a53ad`.
Its CV argument names match that builder; this particular snapshot does not
have the SD-name mismatch found in the 2026 regional configurations.
The benchmark concluded in 2023 and was published in 2024.

Newer category-5 advice, SAG 21271, is recorded separately as
`ices_sandeel_area_4_2026_summary`. It has later catch/index values on a
different survey scale, without an updated N/F/SSB age-based assessment.
Those values are cached but are not used to fill gaps in the 2025 run.
Their precise scaling/likelihood role remains to be audited; the summary
record does not claim completed numerical extraction.

## Recovered inputs and outputs

The native model spans 1993–2024, ages 0–4+, two half-years, combined sexes
and one regional fishery. Age-0 recruitment enters in July; older ages
advance in January. Initial January abundance at ages 1–4+ is freely
estimated, with deterministic older-cohort survival afterward. July
recruitment has a hockey-stick expectation, fixed 44,716-tonne SSB
breakpoint and likelihood weight 0.05. The breakpoint is not the recruitment
plateau. F is proportional to seasonal standardized effort with constant
age/season coefficients, shared ages 3/4+, no time blocks or technical creep.

| Input | Native coverage and units |
|---|---|
| Catch, Table 9.5.1 | 1993–2024, ages 0–4+ in both halves; million fish; age 0 excluded from the likelihood |
| Stock/catch weights, Table 9.5.2 | First-half ages 1–4+, second-half ages 0–4+; grams/fish |
| Maturity, Table 9.5.3 | Same seasonal age grid; supplied proportions |
| M, Table 9.5.8 | Same grid; fixed long-term multispecies averages, integrated half-year hazards |
| Dredge, Table 9.5.4 | 1999–2003, ages 0–1; age 1 in 2003 missing |
| Dredge2, Table 9.5.4 | 2008–2024, ages 0–1; scaled number indices, absolute multiplier unstated |
| Effort, Tables 9.1.5–9.1.7 | Annual and half-year days for a standard 200 GT vessel; second-half header correction below |
| SAG catches | Annual all-age observed tonnes, retained separately from age-count records and predicted yield |

The detailed import contains **1,642 input rows, 20 assumptions and 768
outputs**. There are 44 survey cells but only 43 numerical values: the dash
for Dredge age 1 in 2003 remains missing. All 132 positive eligible catch
cells match the native diagnostic count. Printed zero age counts in several
years coexist with positive SAG total catches; zero-coded age data do not
establish zero total landings. No total-derived age counts replace them.

M is constant over historical years at each age/season, based on the WGSAM
2023 key run. Survival uses `exp(-F_season-M_season)` without multiplying the
integrated hazards by another half. January biology defines SSB with zero
pre-spawning mortality fractions. Annual M at ages 1–4+ is 1.35, 0.95, 0.86
and 0.80. The native population reports January ages 1–4+ together with July
age 0; derived total January abundance sums only the January states.

Outputs include N, annual and seasonal F, July recruitment, January
SSB/biomass, conditional predicted yield and arithmetic Fbar ages 1–2.
Fixed supplied M is not represented as an estimated output. SAG limits are
retained without inferring SEs or an undocumented interval construction.
No uncertainty is invented for N/F tables or derived aggregate sums.

## Effort header correction

Table 9.1.7 prints the Area 4 and Area 5r numerical columns under reversed
headers. Reassigning that pair restores **both** independent identities
`annual = first half + second half` in all 30 available historical rows,
within one rounded day. For 1996, Area 4 has annual 1,501 and first-half
535 days: the second half is 966 days, printed under Area 5r. The column
printed Area 4 is zero and cannot reconcile those totals. Reported positive
seasonal F independently supports the nonzero Area 4 second-half effort.

The numbers themselves are unchanged. Second-half records are labelled
`reconstructed_source_input`, with the column reassignment and evidence in
`transformation`. Direct annual and first-half records retain
`official_table`. Second-half rows for 2007 and 2022 are absent and are not
reconstructed from residual totals or replaced by zero. The original PDF
and paired-column checks remain cached; the exact native effort file is
still unavailable.

## Likelihood and reporting checks

Each Dredge era has separate q and log-observation SDs at ages 0 and 1.
Predictions average abundance over fractions 0.75–1 of season 2, equivalent
to annual times 0.875–1. All four survey SDs are estimated with a 0.3
lower-bound penalty. The three values printed 0.3 are boundary estimates,
not fixed supplied errors; Dredge2 age 1 is 0.8923429. The source C++ uses
these as log-residual SDs, so the report's CV label is approximate.

Catch SDs share ages 1–2 and 3–4+ within each season. With
`estCV=c(0,2,0)`, they are calculated internally from catch residuals and
mapped out of the free parameters. Recruitment SD is estimated. The catch
and index likelihood weights are one; recruitment weight is 0.05. Native
diagnostics report 50 parameters and maximum gradient 0.0002. Source R/C++
was inspected as text; no downloaded scripts were executed to fabricate a
replacement native fit.

The apparent Yield discrepancies are resolved by the native reporting
equation. `Catchtot` accumulates predicted catch only where the observed
and predicted catch cells are positive. This is **conditional predicted
yield**, distinct from unrestricted Baranov yield and observed catch times
weights. Applying that mask reconciles all 32 table values within explicit
rounding bounds. In 1996 it reduces roughly 99,622 tonnes of unrestricted
prediction to about 41,708 tonnes, consistent with the reported 41,518
after rounding. It also explains zero reported Yield in years with some
positive F but no positive age-count observations.

Annual F sums seasonal F within 0.000895. Older-cohort log survival agrees
with N, annual F and summed M within 0.007373, consistent with two-decimal
M rounding. January biomass and SSB are checked against N and biology with
explicit rounding bounds. Annual F is exactly zero in 2009 and 2024;
finite log-F states cannot reproduce these structural zeros.

The summary's future recruitment is the full-history geometric mean
(1993–2024: 49,075,026 thousand fish), whereas the forecast explicitly uses
2014–2023 (53,694,267 in SAG; 53,694,268 from rounded table values). These
are future assumptions, not historical observations. Stale year/value
references in the narrative do not override the matching numerical tables
and configuration.

## Remaining source gaps

The native `4` data folder, unrounded arrays, exact zero-catch flags and
fitted `sas.rds` are absent from the pinned public repository. The declared
software is compatible with the configuration, but the actual production
object/revision is not independently recovered. All three completeness
statuses remain **partial**. The newer summary's numerical extraction is
not claimed complete. Regional recovery does not silently resolve the broad
legacy catalogue entry or complete every North Sea sandeel unit.

Cached originals, hashes, URLs, dates and revisions are recorded under
`source_cache/ck_ices_hawg_dubius_ns/2025_san.sa.4/`. The yield and effort
audits are numerical checks against the source equations/independent
tables; they do not adjust observations to improve tinyAM agreement.
