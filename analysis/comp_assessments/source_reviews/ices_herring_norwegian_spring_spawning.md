# Norwegian spring-spawning herring

## Assessment represented

The canonical record uses the accepted 2025 ICES assessment, configured at
WKBMACNSSH 2025. It is the most recent accepted assessment with detailed inputs
and outputs recoverable for this database. Its fitted catch series ends in
2024; estimated N, F, and summary series extend through 2025. The accepted 2026
assessment is recorded separately because only its summary series was
recovered. Its values do not replace the detailed 2025 record.

The assessment is for Norwegian spring-spawning herring (*Clupea harengus*) in
ICES Subareas 1, 2, and 5 and Divisions 4.a and 14.a. The reported model ages
are 2–12+, with recruitment at age 2. The detailed 2025 output includes
numbers-at-age, F-at-age, recruitment, SSB, catch, and Fbar.

## Inputs and assumptions

The catch table reports numbers-at-age for 1950–2024 in thousand fish and
source age groups 0–14 and 15+. The accepted fit uses 1988–2024. The database
retains ages 2–15+ as reported so later translations can combine ages 12 and
older for tinyAM's 12+ group. Catch weights are retained separately.

The report gives standard natural mortality of 0.9 per year at age 2 and 0.15
per year at ages 3 and older. It also refers to annual mortality deviations in
the stock annex; those values were not recovered, so the database records only
the published baseline surface. Stock weights are annual, and maturity is
reported by birth cohort and age. The maturity report notes that maturity
depends on cohort size and that the 2020 year-class values were not updated
from the previous assessment.

The numerical indices are NASF acoustic abundance at ages 3–12+ (1988–2008
and 2015–2025), IESNS Barents Sea at age 2 (1991–2024), IESNS Norwegian Sea at
ages 3–12+ (1996–2025), and BESS at ages 2–3 (2004–2024). The 2025 fitted
period uses values through 2024. The database keeps source survey units and
records approximate seasonal timing: 0.13 for NASF, 0.42 for IESNS Barents,
0.38 for IESNS Norwegian Sea, and 0.75 for BESS. Exact fitted fleet settings
were not recovered.

The report includes relative standard errors for catch and the surveys.
These are stored as source precision information; tinyAM will estimate its own
observation errors and will not apply the SAM external weights. RFID relative
errors are available, but the numeric index series is only shown in a figure,
so no RFID observations are transcribed. The accepted native SAM object and
its exact process, q-sharing, and uncertainty settings were not recovered.

For a tinyAM comparison, age-specific catch and index values above age 12 are
summed into age 12+. The published age-12 stock weight and maturity are used
as proxies for the 12+ group because no abundance-by-single-age surface above
age 12 is available for a defensible weighted biological average. Maturity
birth cohorts are mapped to calendar year by `cohort = year - age`; this
preserves the source cohort pattern on the year-age grid.
