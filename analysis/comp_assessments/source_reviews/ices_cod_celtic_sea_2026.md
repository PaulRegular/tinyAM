# Celtic Sea cod, 2026

## Official assessment and sources

This record represents the 2026 WGCSE production assessment of Celtic Sea cod
(`cod.27.7e-k`, ICES divisions 7.e-k), used for 2027 advice. The fitted SAM
object is `Cod_CS_WG2026`, covering 1980-2025 at ages 1-7+; age 7 is the plus
group. The run uses stockassessment 0.12.0 (RemoteSha `1cc464b80f6f`), has
optimizer convergence code 0, objective 279.6445, and a positive-definite
Hessian.

- [WKCELTIC 2020 benchmark report](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.5983), which the 2026 report identifies as the source of the current model settings.

The two reports and native SAM object are cached under
`analysis/comp_assessments/source_cache/ck_ices_wgcse_morhua_cs7e_k/assessment_2026/`.
The ignored `source_manifest.csv` records each file's URL, retrieval date and
SHA-256 checksum. The 2020 cod stock-annex PDF was requested from the ICES
publication archive but returned HTTP 401; no replacement copy was recovered.
The native fitted object and benchmark report still provide the numerical
inputs and fitted configuration used here.

## Inputs and assumptions

- The SAM object contains total catch-at-age, including landings and discards,
  for ages 1-7+ from 1980-2025. Catch at ages 1 and 2 is missing through 2003;
  those unavailable cells are omitted from the input table, not treated as zero.
- The model fits two tuning series. The French OTDEF Q2+3+4 commercial LPUE
  index is aggregate, with one observation per year from 2002-2025. It is
  retained as a relative biomass index on its native kg/hour scale, but is not
  translated to tinyAM because tinyAM currently fits age-specific indices.
- The combined Irish IGFS and French EVHOE Q4 VAST series is age-specific for
  ages 1-3 over 2003-2025. Its model timing is 0.855. Table 7.6 also displays
  age 4, but the final SAM object uses only ages 1-3. The report shows 0.000
  for age 3 in 2025; SAM represents that log-scale observation as missing, so
  it is omitted from the input table and from the tinyAM fit.
- The SAM object supplies annual stock weights, catch weights, landings
  weights, discard weights and maturity. The report identifies the numerical
  input tables as Tables 7.2-7.4. Missing discard-weight cells are omitted;
  reported zero values remain zero.
- Natural mortality is fixed at 0.501, 0.330, 0.264, 0.233, 0.211, 0.211 and
  0.211 per year at ages 1-7+. The assessment does not estimate M. Maturity is
  0, 0.54, 0.93 and then 1 at ages 1-7+, and is constant across years. The
  model's F and M fractions before spawning are both zero.
- Recruitment is at age 1, with age 1 in its own N-process variance group and
  ages 2-7 sharing another group. F has six age states, with age 7+ sharing
  the age-6 state. Its process increments have AR(1) correlation across ages
  and one shared process-variance group. Fbar is ages 2-5.
- The commercial index has one catchability group. VAST has separate q
  parameters at ages 1, 2 and 3. Catch likelihood SD groups are age 1, age 2,
  and ages 3-7; VAST uses one SD group and an age-correlated AR residual
  structure. Both fitted indices and catch use lognormal likelihoods.

## Outputs and tinyAM translation

The database includes SAM N-at-age, F-at-age, SSB, total stock biomass,
age-1 recruitment, Fbar and fitted catch/index predictions. The total-abundance
series is derived as the sum of N-at-age over ages 1-7+; no uncertainty is
assigned to that derived total. For N and F, natural-scale SEs are delta-method
approximations from the conditional log-state uncertainty in the SAM fit
object. SSB, total biomass, recruitment and Fbar retain the source 95%
confidence limits.

The tinyAM recipe fits 1980-2025 at ages 1-7+, using catch and VAST. It uses
source fixed M, source stock weights and maturity, a zero spawning time, three
catch SD groups, age-specific q for VAST, one VAST SD group, an IID N process,
random-walk recruitment and a correlated-random-walk F process. The aggregate
commercial LPUE likelihood and VAST's age-correlated observation errors are
not represented. The source's exact age-state sharing, F covariance and N
initial-state treatment are also simplified.

## tinyAM fit diagnostics

The package-default initialization was tried first, without `start_par`. Its
optimizer stopped with an NA/NaN gradient. One retry kept the same observations,
formulas and model settings, using the official SAM N-at-age and F-at-age
surfaces to initialize tinyAM's N, recruitment and F states. The retry returned
optimizer code 1 (`false convergence (8)`), objective 308.9221 and maximum
absolute gradient 0.00298. Standard-error estimation succeeded and the Hessian
was positive definite, but the fit does not pass tinyAM's convergence check.
The attempt records are cached locally in
`results/cache/ices_cod_celtic_sea_2026/initialization_attempts.rds`.

An exploratory fit with independent F random-walk increments and package
defaults also failed with an NA/NaN gradient. That process change was not
retained. Since neither attempt passed the convergence check, no comparison
summary or dashboard was produced.

The final SAM output in 2025 is SSB 98.94 tonnes, total stock biomass 251.39
tonnes, age-1 recruitment 183.20 thousand fish and Fbar ages 2-5 of 1.4348
per year. These values agree with the rounded values in WGCSE Table 7.9.
No tinyAM agreement summary is available until a fit passes its numerical
convergence checks; matching definitions alone do not imply matching fitted
models.
