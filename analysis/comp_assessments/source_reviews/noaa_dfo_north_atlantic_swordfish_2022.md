# North Atlantic swordfish: shared NOAA/DFO inventory unit

**Review date:** 2026-10-30  
**Scientific name:** *Xiphias gladius*  
**NOAA Stock SMART ID:** `10953`  
**Assessment authority:** ICCAT

## Identity and latest assessment

NOAA Stock SMART 10953 and the DFO Maritimes sustainability-survey entry
"Swordfish - North Atlantic" refer to the same North Atlantic ICCAT stock.
The DFO entry is a regional inventory listing, not a separate assessment
unit. The cross-inventory register therefore links both rows to one provisional
candidate unit; no canonical stock record currently represents it.

The latest detailed North Atlantic stock-status assessment located is the
2022 ICCAT assessment using data through 2020. It considered a Stock Synthesis
model and JABBA for advice. The 2026 ICCAT swordfish meeting assessed the
Mediterranean and South Atlantic stocks and considered North Atlantic MSE work;
it did not report a new North Atlantic stock-status assessment. Its North
Atlantic work concerns the management procedure, minimum-size policy, and
discard mortality. This keeps the 2022 North Atlantic assessment as the latest
assessment run for this candidate.

## Model inputs and biological assumptions

The North Atlantic Stock Synthesis model is age- and sex-structured internally,
but its observed data do not include fishery catch-at-age. The 2022 report
describes landings, estimated or observed discards, fleet length compositions,
and CPUE series. Five additional EU-Spain longline CPUE indices are split by
age group, with age inferred from length data. Those are fishery-dependent
indices, not survey abundance-at-age observations. Thus, the model's internal
age structure does not provide the age-disaggregated catch input required for
this candidate set.

The report describes fixed natural mortality of 0.2 for both sexes across ages.
Female maturity is 50% at age 5 and 100% at older ages; fecundity is related to
body weight. Mean weight observations are used for U.S. and Canadian fleets,
but age-specific weight-at-age series were not located in the reviewed current
assessment sources. The annual model has no separate fractional-year timing
for the age-specific Spanish CPUE indices.

## Outputs and screening decision

The assessment reports aggregate stock-status outputs, including spawning
biomass and fishing mortality relative to reference points. The reviewed
sources did not provide annual numeric N-, F-, or M-at-age arrays. The absence
of observed catch-at-age makes the current North Atlantic assessment
ineligible for the age-disaggregated input set. The internal age structure and
age-specific fishery CPUE should not be mistaken for a complete catch-at-age
assessment input set.

The two inventory rows are identity-linked and screened **ineligible** for the
age-disaggregated assessment set. No canonical stock, assessment, input, or
output records were added, and no tinyAM translation was attempted.
