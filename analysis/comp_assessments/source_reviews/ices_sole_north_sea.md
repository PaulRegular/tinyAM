# North Sea sole source review

## Assessment selected

The stock is ICES `sol.27.4`, Solea solea in Subarea 4 (North Sea), matched to the existing Charbonneau–Keith catalogue record `ck_ices_wgnssk_solea_ns_4`. The latest detailed production assessment recovered is WGNSSK 2026. Its Stock Synthesis 3 model uses data through 2025 and reports population estimates through 2025, with 2026 advice-year summary values. The current advice is ICES 2027 advice based on assessment key 23777. The 2024 WKBFLATFISH benchmark introduced the Stock Synthesis 3 reference model.

The previous detailed run is WGNSSK 2025, with data through 2024 and a 2025 forecast. It remains in the database as a historical assessment and as the basis for the existing tinyAM translation; its source data are not carried forward into the 2026 record.

## Sources and local cache

- Current detailed assessment: [WGNSSK 2026](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.32676345), Tables 16.3–16.12 provide catches, weights, biology, abundance indices, N-at-age and F-at-age.
- Historical detailed assessment: [WGNSSK 2025, North Sea sole chapter](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/59358092), from [ICES WGNSSK report, version 4](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.29085995.v4).
- Framework: [WKBFLATFISH 2024](https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.pub.25471987.v1). The sole chapter documents survey standardization, benchmark choices and SS3 structure.
- Annual summaries: [ICES SAG 2025, key 21217](https://standardgraphs.ices.dk/ViewSourceData.aspx?key=21217) and [ICES SAG 2026, key 23777](https://standardgraphs.ices.dk/ViewSourceData.aspx?key=23777), with the corresponding XML exports.

The PDFs, extracted text and SAG HTML/XML are cached locally under the gitignored `source_cache/ices_sole_north_sea_2025/`. `SOURCES.md` there records retrieval date, source versions, URLs and SHA-256 hashes. Public ICES TAF/GitHub searches did not identify a matching native 2026 SS3 run archive; this import therefore uses the detailed official report tables and the ICES SAG machine-readable outputs.

## 2026 inputs

- Landings-at-age: 1957–2025, ages 0–10+, in thousand fish. Discards-at-age: 2002–2025, ages 0–10+, in thousand fish. Age 0 is explicitly reported as zero. Earlier discards are reconstructed in total from landings, but an age allocation is not tabulated.
- Landings weights, discard weights and stock weights: 1957–2025, ages 0–10+, in kg per fish. The report gives age-0 landings weight as 0.01 kg. Quarter-2 catch weights are used as stock weights at the start and end of spawning.
- Maturity and natural mortality: fixed, age-specific values for ages 0–10+. Maturity is knife-edged at age 3. M follows the reported Lorenzen formulation, with exponent −0.288; the values in Table 16.8 are the source values, not estimated surfaces.
- BTS and combined COAST (SNS + DYFS) abundance indices: one annual aggregate value per survey for 1990–2025. The report does not specify a physical scale multiplier, so the reported relative scale is retained. Both are Q3 surveys; tinyAM timing is represented as 0.625.
- The 2016 age-reading-error matrix retained by the assessment is recorded from Table 16.1. Its rows follow ages 0–10 in order and its columns are labelled 0–10. The printed rows for ages 9 and 10 sum to 0.991 and 0.910; they are preserved as printed and not normalized.

## 2026 outputs and assumptions

The report provides N-at-age and F-at-age point estimates for 1957–2025, ages 0–10+. The complete N surface supports a derived total-abundance series by summing ages; uncertainty is not available for either the age-specific or derived totals. Aggregate recruitment, SSB and Fbar remain from the corresponding ICES SAG series (key 23777); SAG supplies uncertainty for historical estimates through 2025, while the 2026 advice-year row is a forecast with recruitment and SSB but no Fbar.

The 2026 production model is SS3 3.30.24.2, single-area and single-sex, ages 0–10+, with recruitment at the start of the year and Beverton–Holt stock recruitment with fixed steepness 0.6646. SSB is calculated at the start of the year, and Fbar covers ages 2–6. Landings selectivity is logistic and fixed except during pulse-trawl years 2011–2021; discards and both survey indices use double-normal selectivity. The 2016 age-reading matrix is retained even though a 2024 exchange produced an updated matrix.

The WGNSSK report's convergence paragraph describes a maximum gradient of 0.0001762 as exceeding a threshold of 0.001. Those values conflict; the database does not use that sentence as independent evidence about convergence.

The 2026 source record is partial because native SS3 files, full likelihood details and age-specific uncertainty were not recovered. Report tables and SAG summaries are kept tied to the same 2026 assessment ID; the 2025 values remain a separate historical record.

## 2025 historical inputs

- Landings-at-age: 1957–2024, ages 1–10+, in thousand fish. Discards-at-age: 2002–2024, ages 1–10+, in thousand fish. Age 0 is not reported in these catch tables and is left absent.
- Landings weights-at-age: ages 1–10+, 1957–2024. The report explicitly gives age-0 landings weight as a constant 0.01 kg; that value is recorded for each year. Discard weights and stock weights cover ages 0–10+ and 1957–2024. All weights are in kg per fish.
- Maturity and natural mortality are fixed age vectors for ages 0–10+. Maturity is knife-edged at age 3. M is not estimated; the reported rates follow the size-based Lorenzen formulation, with exponent −0.288 and scaling based on maximum validated age 26.
- The age-specific survey series are the Q3 BTS index (ages 0–10+, 1990–2024) and the Q3 COAST index combining SNS and DYFS (ages 0–5, 1990–2024). The report’s index tables do not state a physical multiplier, so original values are retained as relative-index units. TinyAM represents Q3 with the quarter midpoint, 0.625.
- Aggregate BTS and COAST index series from Tables 16.8b and 16.9b are retained separately. The report says aggregate survey-biomass indices also inform model scale; their reported values closely match the rounded sums of the age-specific tables. Their dependence is unresolved, so tinyAM must not fit both representations without a deliberate choice.

## 2025 historical outputs and assumptions

The 2025 report provides point estimates of N-at-age (1957–2024, ages 0–10+) and F-at-age (1957–2024, ages 1–10+); it does not provide age-specific uncertainty. The ICES SAG 2025 XML supplies recruitment, SSB and Fbar summaries and lower/upper bounds. Its bounds are defined as mean ± 2 SD; those bounds are retained directly, and no standard errors are inferred. Recruitment is in thousand fish, SSB in tonnes, and Fbar is the mean F over ages 2–6. The ICES SAG 2026 XML supplies the comparable aggregate summary series through 2026; the 2026 row contains recruitment and SSB but no Fbar.

The production model is single-area and single-sex, with separate landings and discards fleets, age-0 recruitment at the beginning of the year, a Beverton–Holt stock-recruitment relationship with fixed steepness 0.6646, time-varying landings selectivity, time-invariant discards and survey selectivity, and selectivity/catchability constraints from age 5 onward. SSB is calculated at the start of the year. The 2016 age-reading-error matrix is retained in the assessment, but its numerical values were not recovered from the cached report tables.

## Completeness and translation limits

Both assessment records remain partial. For 2026, the numerical catch-at-age, weight, fixed biology, aggregate-index and age-specific output tables are present, but native SS3 files, full likelihood details and age-specific uncertainty are unavailable. For 2025, the original source extraction and its limits are retained as historical data. Fixed M is an input, not an estimated M output.

A 2026 tinyAM fit has not been attempted. The recovered BTS and COAST observations are aggregate biomass indices; the current tinyAM translation supports age-specific index observations or aggregate biomass indices paired with age compositions. No matching 2026 age-composition series was recovered. Assigning these totals to ages or deriving compositions from fitted abundance would invent observations, while fitting catch alone would omit the assessment's survey likelihood. The existing tinyAM fit is for the historical 2025 assessment only.

## tinyAM translation and fit

The translation fits 1957–2024 at ages 1–10+, because source catch and F-at-age begin at age 1. It sums landings and discards by year and age where both are reported; before the discard series begins in 2002, the model input contains landings only. It fits the two age-specific Q3 indices at timing 0.625, groups q by survey and age 1–4 versus 5+, and omits the closely related aggregate indices. The index values remain on their reported relative scales. Fixed M, annual stock weights, maturity, and start-of-year SSB timing are retained.

tinyAM estimates an IID cohort-survival process, a random walk for log recruitment, and a random-walk F process with mean ages 2–6. The source's fixed-steepness Beverton–Holt curve cannot be represented with steepness fixed in tinyAM. An initial attempt to estimate the tinyAM Beverton–Holt parameters had a non-positive-definite Hessian and undefined standard errors; switching to the simpler log-recruitment random walk resolved that numerical failure without changing observations or other model settings. This omits the source stock-recruitment curve and should be treated as an approximation.

The final fit passed `check_tam()`: optimizer code 0, maximum adjusted gradient about 0.001, positive-definite Hessian, and successful uncertainty estimation. Residual diagnostics still flag some standardized residual spreads outside 0.5–1.5 and some residuals above 3 SD. The cached dashboard is local at `results/cache/ices_sole_north_sea_2025/dashboard.html`.

Common-definition agreement over 1957–2024 is mixed. SSB has 11.7% mean absolute percent difference, −41.8% terminal difference, and 0.957 trend correlation. Recruitment is 29.1%, +5.9%, and 0.662; N-at-age is 27.2%, −41.1%, and 0.913; F-at-age is 31.7%, +106.5%, and 0.731. Total abundance has 16.2% mean absolute percent difference and 0.693 trend correlation. M is identical because it is fixed to the same source input, not independently estimated. These numbers describe this simplified fit and are not evidence of equivalence to the SS3 likelihood.
