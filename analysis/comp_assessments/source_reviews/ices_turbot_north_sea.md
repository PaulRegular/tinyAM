# North Sea turbot source review

## Assessment selected

The stock is ICES `tur.27.4`, North Sea turbot (*Scophthalmus maximus*), matched to the existing Charbonneau–Keith record `ck_ices_wgnssk_maximus_ns_4`. The existing stock record was corrected to the official scientific and common names while retaining its stable stock ID. The most recent detailed assessment recovered is the final 2025 WKBNSCS benchmark model, run M9 (Fixed Lorenzen's M), with data through 2023. It is retained as the current detailed record. The M9 run was not the model used for 2025 advice.

ICES published 2026 advice and a source-data table with aggregate recruitment, SSB and Fbar through 2025 plus 2026 forecast values. The 2026 table is recorded as a separate summary-only assessment, not combined with the M9 benchmark. The 2023 SSB differs between the sources (3,564.575 t in the M9 object versus 4,685 t in the 2026 table), confirming that their outputs must remain distinct. The detailed model run behind the newer summary was not recovered.

## Recovered model inputs and assumptions

The M9 model covers 1981–2023, ages 1–8 with age 8 as the plus group. It has one residual-catch fleet, the BTS+COAST age-structured survey (1991–2023, ages 1–7), and the BSAS survey (2019–2023, ages 1–8). Both surveys use timing 0.705. Catch-at-age is in thousands of fish; multiplying it by catch weights in kg per fish gives tonnes and closely reproduces the official 1981 total catch (4,759 t calculated versus 4,755 t published, rounded).

Annual catch weights and stock weights are supplied as kg per fish and are internally estimated with SAM GMRF weight models. The canonical input table contains 242 observed stock-weight year-age cells. The fixed female maturity vector is 0, 0.01, 0.58, 0.98, 1, 1, 1, 1. Natural mortality is fixed to the age-varying Lorenzen vector in `nm.dat`; it is an input, not an estimated M surface. The M9 configuration includes AR(1) correlation among F states by age, ties ages 7 and 8 to the same F state, and defines Fbar over ages 2–6. Full configuration keys are retained in the assumptions table.

The age-specific survey values remain on their native relative-index scales. The physical multiplier is not stated, so values are preserved as a native index scale without a guessed conversion. The final benchmark configuration includes BTS+COAST and BSAS separately and excludes Dutch commercial LPUE. Missing observation cells remain missing.

## Recovered outputs and uncertainty

The M9 object supplies fitted numbers-at-age and fishing mortality at age for 1981–2023. Age 8 is 8+, and ages 7 and 8 share a single fitted F state. Recruitment is abundance at age 1. SSB and Fbar are extracted with the `stockassessment` package table methods; Fbar is ages 2–6. Their low/high bounds are generated as exp(log estimate ± 2 standard errors) on the log scale. The log-scale standard errors for N-at-age and F-at-age are retained with their scale stated in row notes. Total abundance is derived by summing N-at-age, with uncertainty left blank because cross-age covariance was not propagated for that sum.

M is fixed, so the database records its age-specific input and does not present it as an estimated output. The 2026 summary table's low/high values are retained as published; its interval level is not stated. For 2026, the table supplies forecast SSB and recruitment but no bounds or F value.

## tinyAM translation and fit

The recipe `ices_turbot_north_sea_2025_benchmark.R` translates the 1981–2023, age 1–8+ series. It keeps both surveys and their 0.705 timing, matches the q sharing and observation-SD groups where possible, uses IID cohort-survival errors and random-walk recruitment, fits correlated random-walk F with four age-based process-SD groups, and supplies fixed age-varying M. It uses the package's default initialization and no custom starting values. The differences from SAM's age covariance, tied F ages 7/8, BTS+COAST residual correlation and weight-state estimation are described in the recipe background.

The M9 output includes fitted stock weights for the complete 344-cell year-age grid, while the canonical observed input series has 242 cells. The 102 missing cells are supplied to the analysis-only observation object from `exp(logSW)` in the official M9 fit. The original observed values are retained unchanged, and the supplement is stored in `outputs.csv` as a derived source output rather than misclassified as an input. tinyAM treats the complete weight surface as fixed.

The fit converged without a starting-value retry: optimizer code 0 (`relative convergence (4)`), objective 472.75, maximum absolute gradient 0.000502, and positive-definite Hessian with standard errors available. Residual diagnostics still identify large standardized residuals, residual spread outside the reference range, and adjacent-year residual correlation; these are retained as model-fit caveats.

The dashboard compares Official and tinyAM outputs. Biomass and SSB use common definitions: official N is combined with the completed weight and maturity surfaces used by tinyAM, rather than compared with SAM native biomass from its estimated latent weight surface. Common-definition mean absolute percent differences are 21.1% for SSB (terminal difference +26.7%, trend correlation 0.920), 24.9% for N-at-age (terminal +25.8%, mean within-age correlation 0.890), 20.4% for F-at-age (terminal −23.4%, mean within-age correlation 0.877), and 13.4% for recruitment (terminal +11.5%, correlation 0.902). Total abundance differs by 10.6% on average (terminal +16.3%, correlation 0.951), total biomass by 11.7% (terminal +19.7%, correlation 0.979), and common-definition Fbar by 10.2% (terminal −20.2%, correlation 0.950). Fixed M is consistent with the supplied input; it is not an estimated fit comparison. Biomass-at-age is unavailable in the comparison. Derived aggregate quantities have no propagated uncertainty.
