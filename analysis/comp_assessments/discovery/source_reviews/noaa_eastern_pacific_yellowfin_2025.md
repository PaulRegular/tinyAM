# NOAA Stock SMART 10168: Eastern Pacific yellowfin tuna, 2025

Reviewed 2026-10-29. NOAA Stock SMART 10168 is the Eastern Pacific yellowfin tuna unit assessed by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). No matching canonical tinyAM stock record was found.

## Latest assessment and evidence

The latest detailed assessment located is IATTC's 2025 benchmark, which uses data through 2023 and reports status at the start of 2024. It is an integrated age-structured Stock Synthesis model and evaluates four spatial configurations (EPO-wide, South-West, North-East, and a shorter North-East series), with risk analyses over alternative growth, natural-mortality, effort-creep and stock-recruitment assumptions.

The assessment does not fit observed catch-at-age or age-composition likelihoods. It fits fishery catches, standardized length compositions and aggregate abundance indices. Indices and standardized length compositions are produced from spatiotemporal models using purse-seine fisheries associated with dolphins for the EPO and NE configurations, and longline fisheries for SW. The length information is central to scaling abundance, but the model does not report an age-specific abundance index. Growth is based on external otolith daily-increment and tagging data; those data inform biological growth rather than providing fishery-specific catch-age compositions. The model's internal age classes therefore do not establish the age-disaggregated observations needed for the current tinyAM candidate screen.

The report documents age- and sex-specific natural mortality estimated externally from tagging cohort analysis and fixed in the assessment model. It also updates growth and reproductive biology, and gives age-structured model assumptions. The report evaluates stock status with spawning-biomass and fishing-mortality reference points and presents probabilistic risk results and trajectories. Annual run-matched numeric N-at-age and F-at-age arrays were not recovered from the report. IATTC's generated Stock Synthesis output pages are publicly viewable but state that files and derivative content must not be redistributed without permission.

This unit is screened ineligible for the age-disaggregated source set because its fitted observations use lengths and aggregate indices, not observed age-specific catch or abundance inputs. The detailed report still documents important model assumptions and stock-status outputs. No assessment event or numerical records were added to the canonical database.
