# NOAA Atlantic Blueline Tilefish — SEDAR 92 (2025)

## Stock units and assessment history

The NOAA inventory contains two distinct regional stock-management entries:
South Atlantic Stock SMART 10381 and Mid-Atlantic Stock SMART 14922. The cached
2026-10-28 Stock SMART snapshot lists each with a 2025 operational assessment
using data through 2023. It records the southern SEDAR 92 ASPIC run (assessment
13944) as rejected because results were too uncertain and the northern DLM
Toolkit run (assessment 13772) as rejected for insufficient data. The prior
accepted southern assessment (2017, Stock SMART assessment 7778) was also an
age-aggregated ASPIC model; the prior accepted Mid-Atlantic entry (2018,
assessment 8902) was catch-only DLM Toolkit.

SEDAR 92 describes one broad Atlantic species range but separates analyses at
Cape Hatteras because the available data differ by region. The southern region
extends from Cape Hatteras to the South Atlantic Council boundary near Key West.
The northern analysis extends from Cape Hatteras to Massachusetts. This does not
match the NOAA Mid-Atlantic management boundary, which begins north of the
North Carolina/Virginia border. Preserve the two NOAA candidate units separately
and document that boundary mismatch; the shared SEDAR assessment process alone
does not establish that they are identical canonical stock units. NOAA's
current species summary still cites the 2017 assessment for South Atlantic
stock-status estimates.

## Age-data and output screen

For the southern unit, SEDAR 92 used aggregate removals and CPUE indices in the
age-aggregated surplus-production model. Following SSC rejection of that model
for management, the May 2025 addendum documented a DLMtool analysis using total
removals in weight, commercial longline length compositions, and life-history
quantities. The DLM methods produce distributions of total allowable catch,
not annual population-at-age outputs. Age and growth data inform life-history
inputs but do not constitute age-disaggregated observations.

For the northern unit, SEDAR 92 used removals in weight, annual commercial
length compositions, and life-history values in DLMtool. The report explicitly
states that no valid age compositions or abundance indices were available north
of Cape Hatteras. Its reported outputs are TAC distributions, not N-at-age,
F-at-age, or recruitment series.

The 2025 analyses therefore do not provide the age-disaggregated likelihood
inputs required for the current tinyAM source set. No catch-at-age, age-specific
survey index, weights-at-age/maturity-at-age series used in an age-structured
model, or comparable age-structured outputs were verified for either current
regional unit. The southern ASPIC results are aggregate point/uncertainty
outputs from a model rejected for management; they do not make the assessment
age-structured. Both inventory entries are screened ineligible for the
age-disaggregated set, while their verified removals, length and life-history
information remain useful source evidence outside that set.
