# NOAA BSAI Greenland turbot (2024)

## Identity and current assessment

NOAA Stock SMART row `NOAA:10054` identifies *Reinhardtius
hippoglossoides* in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands. No canonical stock with
this species and Alaska area is present, so it is provisionally classified as
new pending the remaining cross-inventory reconciliation. NOAA distinguishes
this BSAI unit from Greenland turbot in the Gulf of Alaska Deepwater Flatfish
Complex.

The latest official production assessment located is the December 2024 BSAI
SAFE assessment, Model 16.4c, with data through 2024. The SSC concurred with
use of that model for 2025–2026 specifications. September 2026 Plan Team
materials show replacement models still under review; they are preliminary
and are not mixed into the 2024 production-run screen.

## Age-structured input screen

Model 16.4c is an age-structured Stock Synthesis model, but its fitted
observations are not a standard age-composition series. The model uses
aggregate catch, fishery length compositions, survey biomass indices and
survey length compositions. Survey age-composition records are available for
some years, but the SAFE says they are excluded from the likelihood because
mean length-at-age and length-composition data from the same sources are both
used. The numeric age-composition records and a run-matched reconstruction of
fishery catch-at-age were not recovered. The assessment therefore remains
unresolved for the age-disaggregated input screen; its age-structured model
and age-specific outputs alone do not establish suitable age inputs for
tinyAM.

The model fixes natural mortality at 0.112 per year. Growth is estimated from
survey length-at-age data. Female maturity is specified as a logistic
length-based ogive with 50% maturity at 60 cm; these are not supplied
age-specific input vectors. Exact observation timing for a tinyAM translation
is not stated in the reviewed materials.

## Outputs and limits

The SAFE reports age-0 recruitment and numbers-at-age, as well as total
age-1+ biomass, female spawning biomass and aggregate fishing mortality.
These are useful official outputs, but the run-matched numerical
age-composition inputs and catch-at-age needed to support an age-disaggregated
translation remain unavailable. This is a source-readiness decision, not a
claim that the official Stock Synthesis assessment is not age structured.

The three assessment and review files are cached with retrieval dates and
checksums under `source_cache/discovery_noaa_greenland_turbot_2024/`. No 2026
replacement model was treated as official because the retrieved September
materials present preliminary alternatives for review.
