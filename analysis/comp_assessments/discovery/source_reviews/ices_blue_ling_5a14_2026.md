# ICES blue ling in Subarea 14 and Division 5.a (2026)

**Review date:** 2026-10-30  
**Official stock code:** `bli.27.5a14`  
**Scientific name:** *Molva dypterygia*  
**Assessment year:** 2026

## Stock identity and assessment

The 2026 ICES advice and Standard Graphs pages identify the current stock as
`bli.27.5a14`. This unit is not present in the canonical stocks table. The 2026
MFRI report describes an age-length GADGET assessment, benchmarked in 2025, with
quarterly time steps and separate immature and mature model components.

## Inputs and assumptions

The assessment uses commercial length distributions, quarterly landings, and a
combined survey index split into length bins. The index combines the Icelandic
autumn groundfish survey with East Greenland Greenland-halibut and shrimp
surveys. Maturation is modeled with a length-based ogive, and natural mortality
is fixed at `M = 0.15`.

The report states that there is no reliable age-composition data and no reliable
weight-at-age data for blue ling. It also states that stock maturity-at-age and
stock weight-at-age are unavailable because of difficulties in ageing. The
assessment therefore does not provide the age-disaggregated observations and
biological inputs needed for a defensible tinyAM translation.

## Official outputs

ICES 2026 reports age-5 recruitment in thousands, female SSB and total biomass
in tonnes, and fishing mortality for ages 10–20 with 2.5% and 97.5% limits. It
does not publish annual abundance-at-age or fishing-mortality-at-age surfaces.
Advice record 7206 recommends 1,898 tonnes for the 2026/2027 fishing year.

## Screening decision

This is a distinct, new candidate and is **ineligible for the age-disaggregated
set**. The assessment is age-length based, but its public observations are
length distributions and length-disaggregated survey indices; reliable
age-composition, weight-at-age, and maturity-at-age data are not available. No
canonical assessment, input, or output rows have been added, and no tinyAM
translation has been attempted.

extraction of the MFRI report is a convenience for screening.
