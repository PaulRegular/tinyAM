# NOAA California Quillback Rockfish — 2025 assessment

## Stock and assessment

NOAA Stock SMART ID 15342 is the California Quillback Rockfish assessment
unit. It is separate from any Canadian Quillback stock. No matching
canonical California record was found; the register treats the unit as
provisionally new pending cross-inventory reconciliation.

The adopted 2025 assessment uses data through 2024 and has a native
Stock Synthesis 3.30.23.1 model bundle. The model spans 1916–2024, uses one
area and one sex, has 80 population age classes, and uses age-composition
bins 1–60.

## Evidence and limits

- The model uses total removals in metric tonnes for 1916–2024. Fishery
  age-composition observations include commercial ages from 2007–2024.
  These compositions are not direct catch-at-age observations; any tinyAM
  catch-at-age series must be reconstructed from catch totals and sampled
  age compositions.
- California recreational, CCFRP, and ROV relative-abundance series are
  included, along with fishery-independent age and length samples. The
  native data records July survey observations. The assessment does not
  directly use age-specific abundance indices, so age-indexed tinyAM data
  would be a documented reconstruction from aggregate indices and age
  information.
- The native `natage.csv` supplies year-specific length-at-age growth input.
  The model derives weight-at-age from growth and its length-weight
  relationship; `Report.sso` includes biomass-at-age output. Maturity uses a
  length-based logistic relationship. Natural mortality is fixed at 0.068
  per year in the base model; the report identifies M and steepness as fixed
  at prior values and explores M in its uncertainty analysis.
- Survey index observations are recorded in July; spawning is in January.
  Preserve survey timing when converting observations to fractional-year
  values.
- `Report.sso` includes annual numbers-at-age, catch-at-age, biomass-at-age,
  and F-at-age. The report gives spawning output and recruitment estimates
  with uncertainty.

This is eligible for source curation because the official model files
provide age-composition inputs, biological data, and fitted age-specific
outputs. A tinyAM translation would approximate the source likelihood;
catch-at-age and age-specific indices would be reconstructed rather than
directly observed.
