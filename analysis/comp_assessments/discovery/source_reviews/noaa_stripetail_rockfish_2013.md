# U.S. Pacific Coast Stripetail Rockfish (NOAA Stock SMART 10428)

## Stock unit and latest assessment

NOAA Stock SMART identifies one Pacific Coast unit of Sebastes saxicola. No existing canonical tinyAM stock record matches this U.S. unit. The 2013 assessment report was published in January 2015 and uses assessment data through 2012. Stock SMART identifies the 2013 exSSS run as partially accepted for status determinations only. The 2025 Pacific Coast Groundfish SAFE still identifies the 2013 assessment as the latest assessment and reports depletion above 77.5%; it also says the assessment did not provide a reliable biomass scale. A 2026 NOAA/PFMC stock-definition analysis likewise cites the 2013 data-moderate assessment (although it describes it as conducted in 2015, the cited report and Stock SMART identify the assessment year as 2013). The 2026 preliminary 2027 assessment recommendations do not identify a newer accepted fit.

The current U.S. assessment unit is coastwide. The 2026 Amendment 37 analysis and the assessment itself describe the coastwide assessment scale. This U.S. unit remains distinct from Canadian Pacific Coast records for the same species.

## Age-specific inputs and outputs

The 2013 report's Appendix A.2 includes the model data file. It specifies 38 ages in the population dynamics, but the data file explicitly sets the number of age-composition observations to zero and the number of mean-size-at-age observations to zero. Its observed inputs are annual catches in biomass units and three aggregate survey biomass-index series. Thus the model's internal age structure does not provide observed catch-at-age, age compositions, or an age-specific abundance index.

The assessment includes sex-specific growth, weight-length, maturity, and natural-mortality model settings. Those are model biology and parameters, not a complete run-matched set of observed age-specific tinyAM inputs. The model file sets fishery and survey fleet timing to 0.5 within the season; that is a model timing setting, not independently verified survey-date timing.

The published 2013 assessment presents depletion and fishing-intensity status profiles across alternative survey catchability values. The review panel did not accept a prior for catchability, and the report says the data did not update the population-scale prior. As a result, the assessment was accepted for status determinations, not a reliable absolute biomass scale or age-specific N/F/M output. Current harvest specifications continue to use a data-limited DB-SRA method rather than the 2013 model's OFL estimates.

## Screening decision

Treat NOAA Stock SMART 10428 as one new, coastwide U.S. Pacific candidate and mark it ineligible for the age-disaggregated assessment set. The latest documented fit has an age-structured population internally, but no observed age-composition or age-specific survey likelihood inputs and no accepted age-specific population outputs. Do not substitute older data-limited estimates or reconstruct age inputs that were not used by the selected fit. Do not add canonical numerical records.
