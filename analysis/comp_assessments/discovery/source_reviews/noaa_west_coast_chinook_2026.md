# NOAA West Coast Chinook candidates (2026)

## Scope and identity

This review covers 42 NOAA Stock SMART rows. The initial 12 are Washington
Coast Hoko Summer/Fall (10483) and 11 Puget Sound/eastern Strait of Juan de
Fuca management units (10484–10494). Thirty additional PFMC rows, assessed
through 2025, are listed below. Each has a distinct NOAA stock ID and matching
scientific and common names in the cached 2026 Stock SMART summary. The
canonical database has no *Oncorhynchus tshawytscha* stock, so these are
recorded as distinct new candidate units (`noaa_chinook_<Stock SMART ID>`).
This is an inventory crosswalk only; no canonical numerical records were
added.

For the initial 12, the cached Stock SMART summary marks all latest entries as
2026 operational assessments using “Cohort Analysis.” Composition Input Data is
level 4 for all 12. The NOAA data dictionary says this category indicates a
time series of age-composition data sufficient for assessment methods that use
fishery age compositions. Model Category is 4 (VPA) for 11 units, but 2
(index-based) for Skokomish Summer/Fall (10485). This difference is material:
the metadata are evidence about available inputs, but do not establish that all
12 use the same assessment structure or expose the same annual input series.
Stock SMART is summary metadata and directs users to regional assessment
records for details.

## Source screening

The latest reviewed public documents are the 2026 Preseason Report I and the
Review of 2025 Ocean Salmon Fisheries. Preseason Report I gives run-size and
adult-return forecasts. For Puget Sound it says forecasts are described in
annual management reports by management unit, not by individual species, and
that forecasts are generally dominated by age-4 adults. The reviewed reports
do not expose the annual catch numbers-at-age vectors, an age-specific marine
survey index, stock weights-at-age, maturity-at-age, or age-specific natural
mortality needed to verify a tinyAM-ready input set. The reports also do not
provide a complete N-at-age/F-at-age/M-at-age output surface for these units.

Stock SMART does publish aggregate indicators for some units. In its 2026
summary, an estimated exploitation rate is reported for 9 of the 12 candidates
and a spawning-stock point estimate for 6. The abundance basis varies (natural,
hatchery, or both), and these point estimates do not establish a consistent
population output series across the 12 units. The candidate register records
the available point-estimate units and years row by row. The age-composition
metadata make it inappropriate to mark the units ineligible solely because the
summary reports aggregates; instead, eligibility remains **unresolved** until
the annual regional management reports and underlying assessment inputs are
checked.

Source and output scores are discovery evidence, not reconstructed likelihood
vectors. No age data, model states, or numeric observations were copied into
the canonical database, and no tinyAM translation was attempted.

## Additional PFMC Chinook units

The following 30 NOAA records are full-acceptance 2026 PFMC runs using 2025
data. Twenty-seven have Model Category 4, one has Category 3, and two have
Category 2. Composition Input Data scores range from 2 to 5 (2 units at level
2, 7 at level 3, 20 at level 4, and 1 at level 5). The scores and model labels
come from Stock SMART; they are not observation vectors.

The 2026 PFMC reports provide forecasts, escapement, and fishery-impact
indicators. They do not expose these units' annual age-specific catch and
survey input vectors, run-specific biological surfaces, or complete historical
population output surfaces. The Stock SMART input scores cannot substitute for
those source values. Chinook FRAM documentation describes a separate fishery
management model that starts from regionally supplied abundance by ages 2–5 and
simulates mortality, maturation, fisheries, and escapement. That model detail
helps interpret the forecasts but is not a substitute for the underlying
assessment observations and fitted histories. Eligibility therefore remains
unresolved pending recovery of the unit-level production data.
