# Inside Yelloweye Rockfish

Reviewed 2026-10-29. DFO's Pacific inventory entry corresponds to the inside Yelloweye Rockfish population in Groundfish Management Area 4B. DFO distinguishes it from the outside population on the basis of genetic and geographic evidence. No canonical tinyAM stock record was found.

## Current advice and detailed model evidence

The 2025/26 DFO Groundfish IFMP identifies June 2020 as the latest science advice for Inside Yelloweye. The detailed follow-up, Research Document 2021/008, evaluates rebuilding strategies with six age-structured stock-reduction-analysis operating models conditioned on observed catches, abundance indices, and available age compositions. The analysis covers data through 2019. DFO describes it as a rebuilding and management-strategy evaluation, not a new conventional assessment update.

The report documents age data collected in Area 4B from 1984–2018, primarily from the hard-bottom longline (HBLL) survey after 2003. Survey age compositions are used in the SRA and the model aggregates ages into an 80+ group. The report notes that age-composition samples are small. Commercial age samples are available from one 1989 fishing trip only; the model otherwise uses annual aggregate catches. The public, pinned [`pbs-assess/yelloweye-inside` repository at revision `2f9a8a4`](https://github.com/pbs-assess/yelloweye-inside/tree/2f9a8a4) contains processing scripts and privacy-compliant sample-data objects, including the survey-age and catch preparation workflow.

The report includes biological age and length data and sex-specific maturity-at-age ogives. A run-matched numeric weight-at-age table and a fractional within-year timing for the age observations were not verified in this screen. The report presents operating-model biomass trajectories and probabilities relative to reference points, but not standard annual N-at-age and F-at-age tables.

## Screening decision

Identity is a provisional new unit, but age-disaggregated tinyAM eligibility remains unresolved. Survey age compositions are verified, while the lone commercial age-sampling trip does not establish a representative annual catch-at-age series. The source set also needs verification of numeric weight-at-age, fractional timing, and comparable age-specific fitted outputs. Keep the source record as a follow-up candidate; do not treat the MSE projections as a conventional fitted assessment or fill missing inputs from model states. No canonical assessment or numeric series was imported.
