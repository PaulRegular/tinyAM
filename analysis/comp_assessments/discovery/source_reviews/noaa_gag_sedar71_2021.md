# NOAA South Atlantic Gag Grouper — SEDAR 71 (2021)

## Stock and assessment

NOAA Stock SMART 10349 identifies the South Atlantic Gag Grouper unit
(*Mycteroperca microlepis*). It is distinct from Gulf Gag Grouper (Stock SMART
10348), which has its own candidate unit and SEDAR 72 review.

The latest completed assessment located for the South Atlantic unit is the
SEDAR 71 operational assessment, published in April 2021 and fitted through
2019. It is an integrated statistical catch-age model implemented in BAM. The
current successor, SEDAR 106, was planned for 2026 with a 2024 terminal year,
but the project page says the start was delayed and no new schedule has been
posted. This is therefore a review of SEDAR 71, not the unfinished SEDAR 106
work.

## Inputs and outputs located

The assessment report tabulates annual fleet landings and dead discards for
1962–2019, in 1,000 lb gutted weight for commercial landings and 1,000 fish for
recreational landings and discards. It fits annual age compositions for
commercial handline, commercial diving and headboat fleets; figures show the
observed age proportions, and Tables 4–5 give fish and trip sample sizes.
The report does not provide these fishery composition arrays as machine-readable
numeric tables, so catch-at-age requires digitizing observed proportions and
combining them with source catch totals and age-specific weights.

The model fits two aggregate abundance indices: headboat through 2019 and the
SERFS video index from 2011–2019. The report provides annual values and CVs.
SEDAR 71 WP04 also reports numeric chevron-trap age counts and proportions for
1990–2019. Those trap compositions informed the fitted selectivity of the video
index; the assessment does not fit the trap age compositions as an age-specific
abundance index. A reconstructed age-specific index should therefore be
identified as an approximation.

The report supplies age-specific whole weight, female maturity and sex ratio,
and natural mortality. Female maturity is logistic with age at 50% maturity
estimated near 4.6 years; all males are treated as mature. M is fixed over time,
declines with age under a Lorenzen curve, and is scaled over fully selected ages
5+ so survival to age 30 matches a constant M = 0.15. The age-specific mortality
and biology tables allow the reported assumptions to be represented directly.

Numeric fitted outputs include total abundance-at-age and biomass-at-age,
total biomass, SSB, and recruitment through 2019. Annual fleet fishing mortality
is presented in figures, but a complete numeric F-at-age series and full
run-matched native assessment files were not located.

The stock is eligible for source curation because detailed official inputs,
age compositions, biological assumptions, and numeric age-specific outputs are
publicly documented. The source review should preserve the distinction between
numeric report tables and compositions reconstructed from figures.
