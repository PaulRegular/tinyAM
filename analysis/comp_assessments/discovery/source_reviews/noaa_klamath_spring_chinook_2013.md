# NOAA Klamath River spring Chinook salmon (Stock SMART assessment 2013)

Review date: 2026-11-01

## Assessment identity and current status

NOAA Stock SMART lists one assessment for stock 10610, assessment 7879, from
2013 using data through 2010. It is marked full acceptance and benchmark, with
method “Escapement Index” and model version “Geometric Mean of Escapement.”
The Q4 FY2025 NOAA assessment data-gap appendix still lists 2013 as the last
assessment. NOAA's Q4 2025 stock-status table reports overfishing, overfished,
and approaching-overfished status as unknown. The inventory entry is therefore
a historical accepted status assessment, not evidence of a current age-structured
production model.

The NOAA Stock SMART summary records a 2010 estimate of 4,082 adult spawners
(hatchery and natural) on a five-year-geometric-mean basis. This is an aggregate
summary value. It is not an age-specific population output, and its correspondence
to the component estimates in the 2013 biological review is unresolved; it is not
being copied into the canonical database.

## Inputs and model structure

The NOAA 2013 biological review describes spring-run abundance using adult
(age greater than 2) spawner escapement. It summarizes recent abundance with a
five-year geometric mean and describes trends using log-linear regressions of
adult spawner counts. This is a status and trend analysis, not a full
age-structured production assessment.

The CDFW spring Chinook megatables provide basin-level spawner escapement, river
harvest, and run-size estimates from 1980 through 2023, separated into grilse,
adults, and totals. These broad bins are not a full age composition or
numbers-at-age series and do not provide an age-specific abundance index for the
NOAA assessment. The 2013 review also states that ocean exploitation-rate
information was unavailable for spring-run fish; it does not provide the
age-specific fishing or natural mortality inputs required by tinyAM.

No matching stock-specific annual weight-at-age or maturity-at-age inputs were
found in the reviewed official assessment sources. No age-specific N, F, M, or
recruitment output series was located. The aggregate records are useful context,
but they cannot be expanded into a defensible age-structured assessment without
inventing inputs.

## Decision

Classify NOAA:10610 as **ineligible** for the age-structured candidate set.
The reviewed official sources do not expose the full age-specific inputs,
biology, mortality assumptions, or fitted age-specific outputs required for a
tinyAM translation. This screening result does not claim that no age observations
exist anywhere; it records that they were not recovered as inputs to the
identified official assessment. No stock, assessment, input, or output records
were added to the canonical database, and no tinyAM translation was attempted.
