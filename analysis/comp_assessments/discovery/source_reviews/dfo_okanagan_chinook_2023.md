# Okanagan Chinook SMU (assessment year 2023)

The latest DFO stock assessment located is the 2023 Okanagan Chinook assessment, peer reviewed in April-May 2024 and published as Science Response 2025/003 in January 2025. DFO defines the stock management unit as Chinook spawning in the Canadian reaches of the Okanagan watershed; the unit contains one conservation unit. The current assessment focuses on the summer population because information on the spring run is limited. The population is transboundary, but the Canadian SMU is not the same unit as a broad U.S. Upper Columbia Chinook aggregate. No exact canonical database match was found. NOAA Stock SMART's `Aggregate Chinook Salmon Complex` is not sufficiently resolved to treat it as an equivalent unit.

## Evidence for age-disaggregated inputs and outputs

| Component | Evidence and limitation |
|---|---|
| Catch at age | The 2023 assessment does not estimate absolute catch because recruitment estimates are unavailable. It does not report a fishery catch-at-age input. Fishery harvest on the Canadian SMU is incidental; U.S. Similkameen calendar-year exploitation is used as a proxy for summer/fall Okanagan Chinook, not as an age-specific catch series. |
| Abundance index and age data | The principal abundance series is an aggregate natural-origin spawner index from 2006 onward, based on stream float/walk counts and area-under-the-curve estimates. Whole-population mark-recapture estimates are available for 2020 and 2023, with incomplete intervening coverage. The report says the age estimates needed to assign escapement to cohorts have not been collected sufficiently. It provides no age-specific annual abundance index or age composition used in a population model. |
| Weights and maturity | The assessment does not specify a conventional weight-at-age surface or maturity-at-age input. Biological age ranges and hatchery release ages described in the supporting material are not fitted stock weight/maturity inputs. |
| Mortality | The assessment does not estimate age-specific F or M. It reports a proxy exploitation series based on the U.S. Similkameen indicator stock; the report notes that exploitation is not measured directly for the Okanagan SMU. |
| Timing | The abundance observations are spawning escapement counts, not an annual fishery-independent survey index with a within-year fraction. The assessment provides no survey timing fraction suitable for an age-structured annual observation model. |
| Outputs | The latest assessment reports the aggregate spawner index and status metrics, whole-population abundance estimates for 2020 and 2023, and an exploitation proxy. It states recruitment estimates are unavailable and that the data limitations preclude most traditional assessment methods. It does not report N-at-age or F-at-age. |

## Screening decision

The inventory entry is a distinct new DFO Okanagan Chinook SMU candidate, with assessment year 2023. It is **ineligible for the age-disaggregated assessment set** on the evidence located: the current assessment uses aggregate spawning abundance/status information, does not have cohort-specific escapement and recruitment, and does not supply fishery catch-at-age, age-specific population outputs, or the biological and mortality surfaces needed for a tinyAM-style age-structured model. This does not imply that no age sampling exists; it means the latest assessment's available data and outputs are not an age-structured production assessment. The 2019 Recovery Potential Assessment is retained as historical context for the same unit and is not used to fill gaps in the current assessment.

No canonical stock or assessment data are added. The NOAA Stock SMART aggregate remains unreviewed and unlinked; there is not enough evidence for a one-to-one crosswalk. Revisit this screen if DFO or the Okanagan Nation Alliance publishes run-matched age data or an age-structured assessment.
