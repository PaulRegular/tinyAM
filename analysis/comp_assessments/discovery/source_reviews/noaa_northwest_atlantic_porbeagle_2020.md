# Northwest Atlantic porbeagle: current age-data screen

Review date: 2026-11-01

## Assessment identity and recency

NOAA Stock SMART lists assessment 11387 for stock 10654 as the latest full-acceptance record: a 2021 review with data through 2018. Its model description identifies the Incidental Catch Model (ICM) for overfished status and the Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) for overfishing status. The 2020 ICCAT Porbeagle Stock Assessment Meeting report is the detailed source for the Northwest Atlantic run. The 2024-2025 ICCAT executive summary is newer, but its Northwest stock-status indicators still describe 2018; it updates catch context through 2024 rather than reporting a new population assessment.

The NOAA candidate and ICCAT Northwest Atlantic unit refer to the same management area. The ICES porbeagle candidate already in the register is a distinct Northeast Atlantic unit and is not merged with this one. No matching canonical tinyAM stock is present.

## Inputs and assessment structure

The 2020 report reconstructs annual removals by stock from Task 1 catches, landings and dead discards. These are aggregate catch totals, not numbers caught at each age. The ICM uses removals and life-history assumptions to construct a theoretical age-structured population and evaluate depletion and projections. It was designed for cases where length-frequency and CPUE series may not be available to track abundance. The report compares the reconstructed trajectory with Japanese longline CPUE as context; that does not make an age-specific survey index part of the fitted model.

The report also discusses SAFE and exploratory length-based work. Those methods do not supply catch-at-age or an age-specific abundance-index likelihood for tinyAM. The reviewed production sources do not provide a complete fitted stock weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, or natural-mortality-at-age surface suitable for an age-structured tinyAM translation.

## Outputs and screening decision

The latest executive summary reports Northwest Atlantic relative biomass for 2018 (B2018/BMSY = 0.572), relative fishing mortality for 2010-2018 (F/FMSY = 0.413), and a 98% probability that the stock was overfished in 2018. The ICM report includes an aggregate abundance trajectory and removal projections. The sources do not provide annual N-at-age, F-at-age, or M-at-age surfaces for the assessed years.

Keep the candidate screened and ineligible for the age-disaggregated assessment set. The stock has useful aggregate removals and official status outputs, but the accepted assessment does not use catch-at-age or age-specific survey observations, and the required age-based biological surfaces are not available from the reviewed production sources. Do not add canonical numerical records or attempt a tinyAM translation from these aggregates.
