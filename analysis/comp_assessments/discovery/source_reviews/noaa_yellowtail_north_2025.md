# NOAA Northern Yellowtail Rockfish — 2025 assessment

## Stock and assessment

NOAA Stock SMART ID 10393 is the U.S. northern Yellowtail Rockfish unit,
north of 40°10′ N. It is not the DFO Canadian coastwide unit. No matching
canonical U.S. northern stock record was found; the candidate is provisional
until cross-inventory reconciliation is complete.

The 2025 benchmark assessment was adopted for management advice and uses data
through 2024. The report and native model bundle identify Stock Synthesis
3.30.23.1. It is a single-area, two-sex model with 40 population ages and
composition bins 1–30.

## Evidence and limits

- The model input has three fishery catch fleets (commercial, at-sea hake,
  recreational), with catch in biomass units reported in metric tonnes. The
  fit uses fishery age and length compositions. It does not use a direct
  annual catch-at-age observation series; any tinyAM catch-at-age input
  requires reconstruction from catch totals and sampled age compositions.
- Four index series are included: an Oregon–Washington hook-and-line survey
  in numbers, the Triennial and WCGBTS surveys in biomass, and the SMURF
  recruitment index. Triennial age and length compositions and WCGBTS
  conditional age-at-length data are available. An age-specific abundance
  index is not directly observed and would require a clearly documented
  reconstruction from an aggregate index and age information.
- Sex-specific weight-at-age follows from the fitted growth curves and
  estimated sex-specific weight-at-length relationships. Female age-based
  maturity is estimated from 232 aged histological samples collected north
  of 40.167° N during 2016–2023. Natural mortality is estimated with a
  lognormal prior based on maximum age; the prior uses age 43, the 99.9th
  percentile of PacFIN age observations.
- The native input records July for the survey index observations and for
  Triennial/WCGBTS age data; spawning is in January. Preserve individual
  observation months in any fractional-year translation.
- `Report.sso` includes annual numbers-at-age, catch-at-age, biomass-at-age,
  F-at-age, recruitment and spawning output. The report provides uncertainty
  for key population quantities.

This is eligible for source curation because the native assessment files
include observed age-composition data, age-specific biological information,
and fitted age-specific outputs. A tinyAM version would still be an
approximation: its catch-at-age and age-indexed index would be reconstructed
quantities, not the native observation likelihoods.
