# ICES Thornback Ray in Subarea 6 (2026)

## Assessment unit and latest advice

The ICES assessment unit is thornback ray (*Raja clavata*) in Subarea 6 (West
of Scotland), stock code `rjc.27.6`. It is a distinct unit from other ICES
thornback-ray areas; same-species records from other divisions are not merged
into it. The latest published source located is the 2026 advice for 2027–2028.
The advice record identifies the assessment as Category 3. The advice limits
landings to 51 tonnes in each year and states that corresponding catches
cannot be quantified.

## Inputs and outputs relevant to tinyAM

ICES Standard Graphs and its associated XML describe the stock-size quantity
as `B_index`, in kilograms per square kilometre. The annual series contains an
aggregate biomass index with 95% intervals and reported landings in tonnes.
The XML identifies the data-limited `rfb` method, leaves `Fage` and
`RecruitmentAge` blank, and has no age-specific F series. The reviewed 2026
source set supplies no catch-at-age, age-composition, survey age-index,
weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, or age-specific mortality inputs.

This is therefore not an age-structured production assessment with the
age-disaggregated inputs and outputs needed for the comparison library. The
aggregate `B_index` must not be relabelled as SSB, and advice landings must not
be interpreted as observed catches or population outputs. The candidate is
screened ineligible for the age-disaggregated source set; no canonical stock,
assessment, input, or output records were added.
