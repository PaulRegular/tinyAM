  'The latest detailed updates located are the 2023 Management Track Assessment reports, both using data through 2022. The northern report says the prior AIM model had been discontinued after poor fit in the 2019 operational assessment and uses an empirical method based on paired-gear survey catch efficiencies. It combines total catch with aggregate fall NEFSC bottom-trawl survey indices to estimate swept-area biomass and catch/biomass exploitation rate. The southern report retains the AIM model with aggregate catch and fall NEFSC survey biomass; it reports a three-year moving-average biomass index and relative F defined from catch divided by survey index.', '',
  'Neither current assessment uses catch-at-age, age compositions, age-specific survey abundance, weights-at-age, maturity-at-age, or age-specific natural mortality. Age-reading and biological sampling do not amount to age-disaggregated likelihood inputs. Their reported biomass, exploitation, and relative-F outputs are aggregate empirical indicators, not population-at-age or instantaneous F-at-age surfaces. The assessment sources therefore do not support an age-structured tinyAM source record for either current unit.', '',
