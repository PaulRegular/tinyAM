Description: tinyAM (tiny assessment model; aka TAM) is an experimental R package for fitting 
             ageâ€“structured stock assessment models using RTMB. It is designed to 
             be flexible, modular, and lightweight, making it easy to experiment 
             with different model structures and process assumptions. (Documentation,
